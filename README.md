# gosweep

gosweep is a minesweeper game, written in Go using the [pixel game library](https://github.com/faiface/pixel), with an automatic player built-in

(Originally, this project began as a hack day project at GopherCon 2015; an Android minesweeper clone using [gomobile](http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile))


# auto-gosweep

To have Minesweeper played _for_ you, pass `--director`:
```bash
gosweep --director
```

There are pretty colours showing the actions the director took. Red is a left click (reveal), blue is a right click (flag), and yellow means the director guessed â€” it chose one of the yellow cells at random.

Since the game and director are written in Go, it's FAST, and can handle large boards pretty well.

... and that speed is artificially limited. With the 25ms tickrate removed, games are near-instantaneous
